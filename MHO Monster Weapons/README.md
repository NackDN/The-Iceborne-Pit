# IMPORTANT MOD INFORMATION BELOW

Replaces the generic weapon parts (the model that's slapped onto Ore/Bone weapons) of the following monsters with the corresonding weapons' MHO model:
* Brachydios: DB, HH, Lance, LBG, SA, LS, GL
* Nargacuga: GS, DB, LBG, GL, Lance
* Lavasioth: DB, GS, LBG
* Barioth: LS, Hammer, HH, Bow
* Lunastra: Everything except HBG, CB, and IG
* Yian Garuga: Hammer, GL, LBG
* (Stygian) Zinogre: GS, Lance, SA
* Kirin: SnS, HH
* (Brute) Tigrex: SA, Bow, LBG, DB
* Uragaan: Hammer, SA, LS
* Hornetaur: DB

*In addition*, this mod replaces the base Kulve Taroth weapon models (the 6* "Gold" weapon series) with invisible models--with the intent of the mod user using the in-game Weapon Transmog system to combine the replaced part models with the invisible Kulve bases.

Back when this mod was being actively updated, I did try other methods that could work around the Transmog limitation. However, I was not happy with the end quality of those methods--so this is the one I'm sticking with.

This mod only replaces the weapon parts of the monsters and weapons listed above. In order to replace *all* weapon parts, I would personally recommend to combine my mod with the ***Part Replacer*** version of TWJon's "No More Slap On Weapons" mod (https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterworld/mods/5091).
